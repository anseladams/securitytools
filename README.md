pen testing

1st step
------------
network diagrams 
software flowcharts
physical maps of the org facilities

software testing
---------------
SDK provides code libraries to use
Provides all the things BUT it allows reuse of libraries which could be vulnerable!! [you could test against this]
SOAP Project file
SWAGGER document - open soure framework 
REST - has been replacing SOAP - REST is based on HTTP 

2 Languages that are used
